Evan and Kenneth worked on the skeleton code of the BuyIt application, and created the database using Jaeryn's script.
Evan created the checkPassword() and getUserInfo() and Kenneth created the printLoginMenu() and printRegistrationMenu() for main().
Jaeryn created the mysql script to create the database and tables.
